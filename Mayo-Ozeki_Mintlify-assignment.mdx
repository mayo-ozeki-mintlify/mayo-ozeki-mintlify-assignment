## **#1: Analyze our tools and current campaigns (Day 1 - 20)**

### Go over all Marketing and Sales team-related programs that are in use

- Sales - [<u>Lavender</u>](https://www.lavender.ai/), [<u>copy.ai</u>](http://copy.ai), [<u>Salesloft</u>](https://www.salesloft.com/), [<u>Sendoso</u>](https://www.sendoso.com/), etc
- Marketing - Marketo, Hubspot, Salesforce, Zapier, 6sense, etc

### Get a good understanding of available assets/contents

- What are we promoting at the moment?
- Which ones are getting the most engagements?
- Which ones align with the messaging we are currently promoting?
- New ones that are work in progress?

### Understand our always-on campaigns

- Nurture programs
- Offers

### Understand currently active campaigns

- Look into MQL \+ SQL goals/conversions
- Lead scoring system
- Budget

## **#2: Identify what has and hasn’t been done (Day 21 - 40)**

After analyzing the campaigns from step 1, look deeper into the 3 - 5 top-performing campaigns and their performances.

### **Email campaigns**

- Target audience list - titles, companies, job level
-  # delivered to, open rate %, CTOR %, 
  - Additionally, what is considered good/average/bad?

### **Events**

- How many registrants?
- How many promotions leading up to it?
- Follow-up strategies for attendees/no-shows
- Aligned messaging/storytelling with the Sales team
  - Battle cards and playbooks
  - Relevant content to share and promote (if no UTM, implement UTM structure with the Sales team)

### **Paid ads**

- Budget and cost
  - ROI analysis - Is it doing well? Room for improvement? Conversions that came from paid ads?
- What are we promoting? How often are we swapping content?

## **#3: Building campaigns and goals (Day 41 - 60)**

By this step I should have a good understanding of how things are running, set up, and executed. I’ll also have a gauge of our campaign performance and what’s considered good/bad. From there I’ll be able to able to see our MQL goals, how many campaigns we need to achieve that, and how much budget we have available to work with.

### **What has/hasn’t been done?**

- **For ones we have done**\
  What worked/didn’t work? Why? Can we rerun it with changes and improvements?
- **For ones we haven’t done**\
  Market research and see what the community is seeking. 
  - Ex: Webinar engagements slowed down during peak Covid era (from 2020-2022) but have been performing really well in 2024-2025 due to the topic around AI and how each company utilizes it. May be a good time to invest into at least one or two webinar based campaign per quarter.

### **Target audience and campaign goals**

- **Target job titles**
  - Developers
  - Product marketers
  - Technical writers
  - Developer-led and AI-first companies
- **Target job level**
  - Manager and above
  - Directors and Executives only depending on campaign messaging
- **Goals**
  - Aiming for our MQL/SQL/conversion goals and demo requests for the quarter
  - Brand awareness and engagement

## **Possible campaigns and potential pain points (60-day mark)**

Upon figuring out what our goals are, we can move forward with some campaigns where I’ve seen some success in. 

### **1. Webinar series with supporting assets**

Leading up to the live date for the webinar, we can promote supporting/relevant assets once a week as we invite our prospect database. This is a great way to shine some light on our content, driving traffic to our page, and getting registrations for the webinar. Partnering with guest speakers/evangelists/customers can have an even bigger impact as well. 

After we finish the recording session, we can take the raw footage and clip them into bite-size videos and use them for social posting as well. It's a great way to have people re-engage with the video while highlighting key takeaways and moments for casual lurkers.

### **2. Podcast series with supporting assets**

Although webinars have taken off in the tech scene, podcasts have also seen some success for those who want to simply have it playing on the side as they do their own work. There are programs like [Riverside.fm](http://Riverside.fm) that can allow you to record on-demand webinars and videos while also providing the raw audio files separately. We can then clip them into bite-size audio clips with added subtitles so those who are scrolling through social media with audio turned off can still understand the content.

###  **3. Re-ignite campaign**

This is an email campaign lasting 6-8 weeks where we compile a list of accounts/leads that ended up as closed losses or disqualified due to poor timing in the past 6 months and send a weekly email while offering a small gift in return for their time. It's essentially a list of folks who were interested enough to reach out to engage with us to being with but just didn't end up working out. Sometimes these folks just need a little extra push to get there\! By re-engaging with these folks we can truly see if they were "closed losses" or not. We can provide a playbook for the sales team so they'll be able to respond when/if they do reach out to us.

### **Potential pain point**

I believe some of the hardest part of closing deals is when the product users and contract signers are different. I've seen many instances where the users loved the product, but the signer didn't want to provide the budget for it. Or poor communication from the user end, leaving us in the dust without being able to loop in the contract signer. Luckily, in most cases, it seems like the users feel our pain just as much. By keeping that in mind while we work on the messaging of our campaigns, we can get one step closer to getting a hold of the contract signers even sooner than we usually do.
